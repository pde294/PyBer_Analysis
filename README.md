## Results
-	https://github.com/pde294/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png
-	The total number of rides accounted for in this dataset is 2,375.
-	The total number of drivers is 68,709.
-	In terms of total fares, urban riders have spent more on total fares over time for rides (over $39,000  for urban riders on total fares in comparison to over $19,000 for suburban riders and over $4,000 for rural riders).
-	However, in terms of average fares per ride, rural riders spend more than urban and suburban riders (at an average fare per ride of $34.62 for rural riders versus $30.97 for suburban riders and $24.53 for urban riders).
-	Additionally, for average fares per driver, rural riders also spent more than urban and suburban riders (at an average fare per driver of $8.06 for rural riders versus $2.26 for suburban riders and $0.67 for urban riders).
## Summary
-	The first recommendation would be to hire more drivers in rural areas.  
-	The second recommendation would be to slightly increase fares in urban areas. 
-	The third recommendation would be to slightly decrease fares in suburban areas.
