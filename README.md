# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
-	The purpose of this analysis is to examine data on rides for the ridesharing service PyBer. A dataset including information on numbers of rides, drivers, fares, and city type (rural, suburban, and urban) was utilized for the analysis. Analysis and visualizations were made with Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This analysis was conducted to determine actionable insights on better serving customers in areas of demand while promoting affordability for rides. 
  
## Results
***Rider and Driver Totals***
-	The total number of rides accounted for in this dataset is 2,375.
-	The total number of drivers is 68,709.

***Fares by City Type***

-	In terms of total fares, urban riders have spent more on total fares over time for rides (over $39,000  for urban riders on total fares in comparison to over $19,000 for suburban riders and over $4,000 for rural riders).
-	However, in terms of average fares per ride, rural riders spend more than urban and suburban riders (at an average fare per ride of $34.62 for rural riders versus $30.97 for suburban riders and $24.53 for urban riders).
-	Additionally, for average fares per driver, rural riders also spent more than urban and suburban riders (at an average fare per driver of $8.06 for rural riders versus $2.26 for suburban riders and $0.67 for urban riders).


***Fares by Month***

 -For the rider data available from January to May 2019, March was the month that had the highest fares for suburban and urban riders, while April was the month that had the highest fares for rural riders. 

## Summary
-	The first recommendation would be to hire more drivers in rural areas. More divers in rural areas would mean as well that there would be more rides and the cost of rural ridesharing may decrease for the riders.  
-	The second recommendation would be to slightly increase fares in urban areas. This price increase would be reasonable given that urban riders most likely have other options for transportation available and also given that the current average fare per driver is quite low at $0.67. 
-	The third recommendation would be to slightly decrease fares in suburban areas. This price decrease would allow rides to be more affordable, given that suburban areas do have a good demand for ridesharing.
