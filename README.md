#PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
-	The purpose of this analysis is to examine data on rides for the ridesharing service PyBer. A dataset including information on numbers of rides, drivers, fares, and city type (rural, suburban, and urban) was utilized for the analysis. Analysis and visualizations were made with Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This analysis was conducted to determine actionable insights on better serving customers in areas of demand while promoting affordability for rides. 
  
## Results
-	The total number of rides accounted for in this dataset is 2,375.
-	The total number of drivers is 68,709.

-	In terms of total fares, urban riders have spent more on total fares over time for rides (over $39,000  for urban riders on total fares in comparison to over $19,000 for suburban riders and over $4,000 for rural riders).
-	However, in terms of average fares per ride, rural riders spend more than urban and suburban riders (at an average fare per ride of $34.62 for rural riders versus $30.97 for suburban riders and $24.53 for urban riders).
-	Additionally, for average fares per driver, rural riders also spent more than urban and suburban riders (at an average fare per driver of $8.06 for rural riders versus $2.26 for suburban riders and $0.67 for urban riders).
## Summary
-	The first recommendation would be to hire more drivers in rural areas.  
-	The second recommendation would be to slightly increase fares in urban areas. 
-	The third recommendation would be to slightly decrease fares in suburban areas.
